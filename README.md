# flight-simulator
This is a class project from my CSE 167: Computer Graphic course at University of California of San Diego.   The project is a basic flight simulator that includes a WWII fighter plane modele, procedurally generated terrain, water, a skybox, procedurally generated buildings, and city layouts.  The project is written using Visual Studio, C++, OpenGL, and GLSL.
